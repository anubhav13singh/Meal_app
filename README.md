# ReactJS MEals App

In this project I have tried to make an awesome Meal Application using **_ReactJS_** , **_ReactHooks_** , **_Axios_** , **_ContextApi_** and tried to give a loading feature using **_React loading Skeleton_**

We are going to use **TheMealDb** Api to fetch the data and display it nicely on the **DOM** by creating 3 pages using _React Router_

Here you can search any meal by its name and by clicking it you can get its ingidients and its way of making

For *API* i have used MealDb API
